					 <h3> Introduction </h3>
							<p style="text-align:justify; text-justify:inter-ideograph;"> 
									In recent years, with the rapid rise of short videos, live broadcastsand other media-based applications, the widespread transmission of video data has led to a significant
									increase in user-generated content. 
									A wide variety of creative platforms and pattern have emerged, and media publication criteria is becoming more and more civilian,
									leading to more complex and dynamic acoustic scenes in various long or short video and live streaming. 
									The problems of video subtitle recognition and speech recognition under various scenarios have been of considerable concern by researchers. 
									The development of methods accurately recognize and understand various types of video content has become an indispensable tool in downstream applications such as subtitle creation, content recommendation, digital media
									archival, and so on. 
									In this challenge, we focus on extracting subtitles from videos using both visual and audio modalities. Most previous works exploit it with a single modality , and each modality has its own
									advantages and annotation difficulties on various types of training data. 
									To this end, we present tasks that explore the integration of the advantages of both video and audio modalitioes. 
									We expect to obtain high precision subtitles with lower annotation costs, thus expanding the scope of practical applications.

						<h3> Task </h3>
                        <p style="text-align:justify; text-justify:inter-ideograph;"> 
							Videos carry rich information with both visual (including text) and audio modality.
							Video understanding has been a popular research topic in both academia and industry.
							The development of methods to fuse the multi-modal information is also a
							challenging and meaningful exploration.
							<br>
							In this challenge, we focus on extracting subtitles from videos. Subtitles are the text
							derived from either a transcript or screenplay of the dialogue or commentary in
							videos. Subtitles may be the most important text information for video data, as they
							contain information of what the people said. They are widely used in
							recommendation, retrieval and video understanding systems.
							<br>
							Subtitles refer to the text displayed in the video after converting the audio into
							accurate text, however the text in the video is not always belong to subtitles. For
							example, the text in the blue boxes in the figure is not a subtitle, but the text in the red
							box that converts audio into text is a subtitle.
