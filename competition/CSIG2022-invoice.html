					 For all participants， 
					 <br><br>
					 First of all, thank you very much for participating in the CSIG 2022 Competition on Invoice Recognition and Analysis.  The next stage of the competition will release a new data set (Test-B) for testing. The second stage will start at 4:00 UTC (12:00 UTF +8), June 24.
                     <br><br>
                     Since the Codalab platform cannot provide real-name authentication, in order to ensure the fairness of subsequent competitions as well as the information can be synchronized immediately, it is necessary to verify the information of all participants in the next stage.  Only the results submitted by teams that have passed the verification of information are considered valid.  We promise that all verification information will only be used for identity verification of participants in this competition and will not be disclosed in any form.
                     <br><br>
                     Team leaders are requested to send the following information to  <a href=mailto:qiaoliang6@hikvision.com>qiaoliang6@hikvision.com</a> in 23:59 (UTF+8) 23 June for the authentication. <br>
                     
					
					- <strong>User ID </strong>: XXX (the ID of the score submitted on the Codalab website, which acts as a unique identity and cannot be changed after identity verification).<br>
					- <strong>Team name</strong>: XXX. <br>
					- <strong>Team member information</strong>: (Provide the names, phone numbers and units of all participating members), for example: <br>
					&nbsp &nbsp	1) Zhang SAN, 188XXXX1234, Hikvision Research Institute <br>
					&nbsp &nbsp	2) Li Si, 178XXXX8394, Hikvision Research Institute <br>

					 <h1> Introduction </h1>
							<p style="text-align:justify; text-justify:inter-ideograph;"> 
									Invoice recognition is a very important part of financial office automation, which aims to automatically extract predetermined content (such as date and amount) from scanned invoices. Due to the problems of various layouts, blurred handwriting, and misplaced text in scanned tickets, it is a very challenging task to accurately locate, identify and structure the fields of the invoices.
                                    <br><br>
									This time we released the invoice analysis and identification challenge. This competition is related to cutting-edge technologies such as computer vision, natural language processing, and multimodal fusion, and has great technical value and practical social application value. We sincerely invite the vast number of algorithm experts and technology enthusiasts to participate, to design better invoice recognition algorithms, and to further promote the implementation of OCR in real production scenarios.
									<br><br>
									We use the <a href="https://codalab.lisn.upsaclay.fr/competitions/3823"> CodaLab </a> as the competition platform. Participants need to register to take part in the competition. Please, follow the instructions: 1) Sign up in CodaLab. 2) Join in CodaLab to the Invoice Analysis and Identification Challenge. Just click in the “Participate” tab for the registration.  Detailed rules are listed in section of "Terms and Condistion".
									
									<!-- Anonymous participants: participants are allowed to decide at the end of the competition whether they would like to include their names and affiliations in the competition report or not. Nevertheless, the organizers might include the results and some information about the systems but always completely anonymized. -->
