                <h2>Abstract</h2>
Existing semi-supervised learning (SSL) studies typically assume that unlabeled
and test data are drawn from the same distribution as labeled data. However, in
many real-world applications, it is desirable to have SSL algorithms that not only
classify the samples drawn from the same distribution of labeled data but also
detect out-of-distribution (OOD) samples drawn from an unknown distribution.
In this paper, we study a setting called semi-supervised OOD detection. Two
main challenges compared with previous OOD detection settings are i) the lack
of labeled data and in-distribution data; ii) OOD samples could be unseen during
training. Efforts on this direction remain limited. In this paper, we present an
approach STEP significantly improving OOD detection performance by introducing
a new technique: Structure-Keep Unzipping. It learns a new representation space in
which OOD samples could be separated well. An efficient optimization algorithm
is derived to solve the objective. Comprehensive experiments across various OOD
detection benchmarks clearly show that our STEP approach outperforms other
methods by a large margin and achieves remarkable detection performance on
several benchmarks.

         <h2>Highlights Contributions</h2>
                	<p> ❃ We propose a practical setting for OOD detection, called semi-supervised OOD detection. </p>
			<p> ❃ To alleviate the problem of Mahalanobis distance that the necessary covariance matrix Σˆ
is hard to be estimated with limited ID samples, we present a new distance calculated in a
detection-specific space as OOD confidence scores.</p>
			<p> ❃ We evaluate our approach with comprehensive experiments across various OOD detection
benchmarks. Our proposal outperforms previous methods by a large margin and achieves
remarkable detection performance on several benchmarks.</p>
