                <h2>Abstract</h2>
Text recognition is a popular topic in recent years for its
broad applications. In this work, we excavate the implicit task, character
counting within the traditional text recognition, without additional
labor annotation cost. The implicit task plays as an auxiliary branch
for complementing the sequential recognition. We design a two-branch
reciprocal feature learning framework in order to adequately utilize the
features from both the tasks. Through exploiting the complementary effect
between explicit and implicit tasks, the feature is reliably enhanced.
Extensive experiments on 7 benchmarks show the advantages of the
proposed methods in both text recognition and the new-built character
counting tasks. In addition, it is convenient yet effective to equip
with variable networks and tasks. We offer abundant ablation studies,
generalizing experiments with deeper understanding on the tasks. Code
is available.

                <h2>Highlights Contributions</h2>
                	<p> ❃ We propose a unified framework VSR for document layout analysis, combin-
ing vision, semantics and relations. </p>
			<p> ❃ We dig the implicit task in the traditional STR, i.e., character counting,
without any extra annotation cost. The counting network supervised by new ex-
ploited labels can be regarded as an auxiliary part in addition to the recognition
task, facilitating positive outcomes. Also, we offer a strong baseline for the sole
newly-built character counting task based on the existing STR datasets.</p>
			<p> ❃ We propose a multi-task learning framework called RF-L for STR through
exploiting the complementary effect between two different tasks, word recogni-
tion and counting respectively. And the two tasks are learned in their own branch,
in interaction to the other, via a simple yet effective RF-Adaptor module.</p>
			<p> ❃ The proposed method achieves impressive improvements in multiple bench-
marks, not only in STR tasks but also in counting. The auxiliary network and
the adaptor can be easily integrated into deep neural network with any other
scene text recognition method, which boosts the single task via the proposed
RF-L framework as verified in extensive experiments.</p>
