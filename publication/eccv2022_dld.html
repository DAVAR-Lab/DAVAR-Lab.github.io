                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                End-to-end text spotting has attached great attention recently due to its benefits on global optimization and high maintainability for real applications. However, the input scale has always been a
tough trade-off since recognizing a small text instance usually requires
enlarging the whole image, which brings high computational costs. In
this paper, to address this problem, we propose a novel cost-efficient Dynamic Low-resolution Distillation (DLD) text spotting framework, which
aims to infer images in different small but recognizable resolutions and
achieve a better balance between accuracy and efficiency. Concretely,
we adopt a resolution selector to dynamically decide the input resolutions for different images, which is constraint by both inference accuracy
and computational cost. Another sequential knowledge distillation strategy is conducted on the text recognition branch, making the low-res input obtains comparable performance to a high-res image. The proposed
method can be optimized end-to-end and adopted in any current text
spotting framework to improve the practicability. Extensive experiments
on several text spotting benchmarks show that the proposed method
vastly improves the usability of low-res models.
