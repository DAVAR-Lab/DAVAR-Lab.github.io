                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                Open Set Recognition (OSR) has been an emerging topic.
Besides recognizing predefined classes, the system needs to
reject the unknowns. Prototype learning is a potential manner to handle the problem, as its ability to improve intra-class
compactness of representations is much needed in discrimination between the known and the unknowns. In this work,
we propose a novel Prototype Mining And Learning (PMAL)
framework. It has a prototype mining mechanism before the
phase of optimizing embedding space, explicitly considering two crucial properties, namely high-quality and diversity
of the prototype set. Concretely, a set of high-quality candidates are firstly extracted from training samples based on
data uncertainty learning, avoiding the interference from unexpected noise. Considering the multifarious appearance of
objects even in a single category, a diversity-based strategy
for prototype set filtering is proposed. Accordingly, the embedding space can be better optimized to discriminate therein
the predefined classes and between known and unknowns.
Extensive experiments verify the two good characteristics
(i.e., high-quality and diversity) embraced in prototype mining, and show the remarkable performance of the proposed
framework compared to state-of-the-arts.

                <h2>Highlights Contributions</h2>
                	<p> ❃ Different from
the common usage of implicitly learnable prototypes, we
pay more attention on choosing prototypes with explicit criteria for OSR tasks. We point out the two important attributes of prototypes, namely the high-quality and diversity. </p>
			<p> ❃ We design a OSR framework by prototype mining and learning.
In the prototype mining phase, the above
two key attributes are taken into consideration. In the embedding learning phase, with the chosen prototypes as fixed
anchors for each class, a better embedding space is learned,
without any sophisticated skills for convergence.</p>
			<p> ❃ Extensive experiments on multiple OSR benchmarks show that
our method is powerful to discriminate the known and unknowns, surpassing the state-of-the-art performance by a
large margin, especially in complicated large-scale tasks.</p>
