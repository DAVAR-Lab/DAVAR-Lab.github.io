                <h2>Abstract</h2>
Table structure recognition is a challenging task due to the
various structures and complicated cell spanning relations. Previous methods
handled the problem starting from elements in diferent granularities
(rows/columns, text regions), which somehow fell into the issues like
lossy heuristic rules or neglect of empty cell division. Based on table
structure characteristics, we find that obtaining the aligned bounding
boxes of text region can effectively maintain the entire relevant range
of different cells. However, the aligned bounding boxes are hard to be
accurately predicted due to the visual ambiguities. In this paper, we aim
to obtain more reliable aligned bounding boxes by fully utilizing the visual
information from both text regions in proposed local features and
cell relations in global features. Specifically, we propose the framework
of Local and Global Pyramid Mask Alignment (LGPMA), which adopts
the soft pyramid mask learning mechanism in both the local and global
feature maps. It allows the predicted boundaries of bounding boxes
to break through the limitation of original proposals. A pyramid mask
re-scoring module is then integrated to compromise the local and global
information and refine the predicted boundaries. Finally, we propose a
robust table structure recovery pipeline to obtain the final structure, in
which we also effectively solve the problems of empty cells locating and
division. Experimental results show that the proposed method achieves
competitive and even new state-of-the-art performance on several public
benchmarks.

                <h2>Highlights Contributions</h2>
                	<p> ❃ We propose a novel
framework called LGPMA Network that compromises the visual features from
both local and global perspectives. The model makes full use of the information
from the local and global features through a proposed mask re-scoring strategy,
which can obtain more reliable aligned cell regions. </p>
			<p> ❃ We introduce a uniform
table structure recovering pipeline, including cell matching, empty cell searching,
and empty cell merging. Both non-empty cells and empty cells can be located
and split effcaciously.</p>
			<p> ❃ Extensive experiments show that our method achieves
competitive and even state-of-the-art results on several popular benchmarks.</p>
